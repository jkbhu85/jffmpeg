Java port of Ogg Vorbis
-----------------------

The files in this directory and subdirectories are under a BSD-style
license.  The license is the same as the original libvorbis library.  

Note that to redistribute this library, you MUST correctly
split this Codec out of the rest of JFFMPEG.  This is simple: remove
any Class files that are not headed with the appropriate BSD copyright.

The file VorbisDecoder.java has a dependency on the
net.sourceforge.jffmpeg.JMFCodec interface.  As this class is not
under the same license, the "import" and "implements" should be
altered so that there is no requirement to use that class.  The
implementations of JMFCodec methods in VorbisDecoder.java do not need
to be removed (although you can do so).

Once separated from the rest of JFFMPEG the Ogg Vorbis port is a
stand-alone JMF Codec and Demultiplexer.


Note that just as the OggVorbis files can be built and shipped
independently of the rest of JFFMPEG, so the rest of JFFMPEG can be
built and shipped without the OggVorbis codec.  

The OggVorbis codecs and demultiplexers, and the other parts of
jffmpeg are shipped as two completely separate components.  If in
doubt, consult a lawyer.
